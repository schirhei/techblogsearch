        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>Take the url of a Github repository. Copy the last part of the url.</p>
        <p>For example.

               <p>github.com/schirhei/techblogsearch --> <b>schirhei/techblogsearch</b></p> 
        </p>
            <p>Enjoy browsing the blogs of the contributors.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>I built this to streamline one of my favorite hobbies. You can find lots of interesting tidbits from these blogs.
        </p>
        <p>And it's an easy way to find resources for a subject this way (as long as it's related to tech).</p>
