### How to use

Search any subject you are interested in. Techblogsearch looks for github repositories that are related to it.
Then it lists contributors that have a blog.

### Why?

I built this to streamline one of my favorite hobbies. You can find lots of interesting tidbits from these blogs.
And it's an easy way to find resources for a subject this way (as long as it's related to tech)
