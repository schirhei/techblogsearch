### How to use
Take the url of a Github repository. Copy the last part of the url.

For example.
github.com/schirhei/techblogsearch --> schirhei/techblogsearch

Enjoy browsing the blogs of the contributors.

Note that you can make only 60 requests/hour to github's API without authentication. Respect the API and try not to spam it.

### Why?

I built this to streamline one of my favorite hobbies. You can find lots of interesting tidbits from these blogs.
And it's an easy way to find resources for a subject this way (as long as it's related to tech)
