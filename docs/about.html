        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>Search any subject you are interested in. Techblogsearch looks for github repositories that are related to it.</p>
        <p>Then it lists contributors that have a blog.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>I built this to streamline one of my favorite hobbies. You can find lots of interesting tidbits from these blogs.
        </p>
        <p>And it's an easy way to find resources for a subject this way (as long as it's related to tech).</p>
