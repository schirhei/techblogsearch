        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>Take the url of a Github repository. Copy the last part of the url.</p>
        <p>For example.
                <br />github.com/schirhei/techblogsearch --> schirhei/techblogsearch
        </p>
            <p>Enjoy browsing the blogs of the contributors.</p>
            Note that you can make only 60 requests/hour to github's API without authentication.
            Respect the API and try not to spam it.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>I built this to streamline one of my favorite hobbies. You can find lots of interesting tidbits from these blogs.
        </p>
        <p>And it's an easy way to find resources for a subject this way (as long as it's related to tech)</p>
